# Data Product Levels

These are derived from NASA[^1] and NEON



| Level | Description | Examples | 
| -- | -- |--|
| 0 |  Reconstructed, unprocessed, full resolution instrument data; artifacts and duplicates removed.|  |
| 1a | Level 0 plus time-referenced and annotated with calibration coefficients and georeferencing parameters (level 0 is fully recoverable from level 1a data). |  |
| 1b | Level 1a processed to sensor units (level 0 not recoverable) |  |
| 2 | Derived variables (e. g., NDVI, height, fluorescence) at the level 1 resolution. |  |
| 3 | Level 2 mapped to uniform grid, missing points gap filled; overlapping images combined |  |
| 4| 'phenotypes' derived variables associated with a particular plant or genotype rather than a spatial location |  |  |
