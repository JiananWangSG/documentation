# Phenotype data

Phenotype data is derived from images generated by the indoor LemnaTec Scanalyzer 3D platform at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center using [PlantCV](http://plantcv.danforthcenter.org).  PlantCV is an image analysis package for plant phenotyping. PlantCV is composed of modular functions in order to be applicable to a variety of plant types and imaging systems. PlantCV contains base functions that are required to examine images from an excitation imaging fluorometer \(PSII\), visible spectrum camera \(VIS\), and near-infrared camera \(NIR\). PlantCV is a fully open source project: [https:\/\/github.com\/danforthcenter\/plantcv](https://github.com/danforthcenter/plantcv). For more information, see:

For the TERRA-REF project, a PlantCV Clowder extractor was developed to analyze data from the [Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility](http://www.danforthcenter.org/scientists-research/core-technologies/phenotyping) at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center. Resulting phenotype data is stored in BETYdb.

## **Data access**

* **Clowder**: [ddpscIndoorSuite](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/clowder/collection/5801db174f0c4d7a6b209f77)
* **Globus**: `/sites/danforth/raw_data/<experiment name>`
* **BETYdb**: [https:\/\/terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu\/bety](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety)

For details about accessing BETYdb, please see [Data Access](../user/how-to-access-data.md) section.

## Computational pipeline

[**PlantCV extractor**](https://github.com/terraref/extractors-lemnatec-indoor)

* **Description**: Processes VIS\/NIR images captured at several angles to generate trait metadata. The trait metadata is associated with the source images in Clowder, and uploaded to the configured BETYdb instance.

* **Output CSV**: `/sites/danforth/Level_1/<experiment name>`
