##Manually Collected Field Data

Data collected manually to verify the sensor-collected data.

**Experimental Design**: 7 experiments were conducted during the sorghum first-year planting.

|Experiment|Experimental Design|
| --- | --- |
| BAP | Biomass Association Panel, 3 reps, 30 lines (12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain), RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Night illumination | 3 reps, 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines (with check line separating illumination levels), RCB |
 | Row # | 3 reps, 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS) x 2 sides (east or west), RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
 | Biomass | 3 reps, 5 sampling times x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS), RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Density | 3 reps, 3 densities (5, 15, 30 cm) x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS), RCB |
 | RILs | 3 reps, 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep, Incomplete Block (row-column alpha lattice design) |
 | Uniformity | 17 reps, 2 lines (forage, PS), No experimental design - Same line planted in single range |
 | Range: | 54 ranges that run in the East-West direction, 4 m length per range (=3.5 m planted plus 0.5 m alley) |
 | Stand count: | Manual counts of all emerged plants with visible coleoptile, by row within plots. |

PI=photoperiod insensitive PS=photoperiod sensitive MPS= moderately photoperiod sensitive



**Data Collection**

| Variable | Method |
| --- |--- |
| Plant Height Date|Canopy height for single row of central 2 data rows of 4-row plot. Measured in cm using meter stick, taken at the height representing the plot 'potential', ignoring stunted plants. The canopy height was measured as the height of the foliage (not the inflorescence) at the general top of the canopy where the upper leaves bend and/or establish a canopy surface that would support a very light horizontal object (imagining a light sheet of rigid plastic foam), discounting rare or exceptional leaves in the upper-most 2 or 3 percentile. |
|Panicle Height Date|Height of the top of the inflorescence panicle for single central data row of 4-row plot, when panicle extends notably above canopy height.|
