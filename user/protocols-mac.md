####Manually Collected Field Data

| Variable | Method |
| --- |--- |
| Plant Height Date|Canopy height for single row of central 2 data rows of 4-row plot. Measured in cm using meter stick, taken at the height representing the plot 'potential', ignoring stunted plants. The canopy height was measured as the height of the foliage (not the inflorescence) at the general top of the canopy where the upper leaves bend and/or establish a canopy surface that would support a very light horizontal object (imagining a light sheet of rigid plastic foam), discounting rare or exceptional leaves in the upper-most 2 or 3 percentile. |
|Panicle Height Date|Height of the top of the inflorescence panicle for single central data row of 4-row plot, when panicle extends notably above canopy height.|
