#Scientific objectives and experimental design

####Phenotyping

The TERRA-REF project is phenotyping the same genotypes of sorghum at multiple locations
 - [Automated Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field System ](/user/protocols-field-scanner.md)at [Maricopa Agricultural Center ](/user/experimental-design-mac.md)(MAC)
 - [PhenoTractors ](/user/protocols-tractor.md)on parallel plots at [MAC ](/user/experimental-design-mac.md)and Kansas State University (KSU)
 - [UAV ](/user/protocols-UAV.md)platform on parallel plots at KSU
 - [Controlled-environment phenotyping systems](/user/controlled-environment-protocols.md) at the [Danforth Center](/user/experimental-design-danforth.md)
- [Manually collected field data](/user/protocols-manual.md) at all locations

####Genotyping

[Whole genome resequencing](/user/experimental-design-genomics.md) is being carried out on ~[400 sorghum accessions](/user/sorghum-lines-genomics.md) to understand the landscape of genetic variation in the selected germplasm and enable high-resolution mapping of bioenergy traits with genome wide association studies (GWAS). Additionally, ~200 sorghum recombinant inbred lines (RILs) will be characterized with ~400,000 genetic markers using genotyping-by-sequencing ([Morris et al., 2013](http://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2013/09/13/g3.113.008417)) for trait dissection in the RIL population and testcross hybrids of the RIL population.
