 #Scientific objectives and experimental design

###Overview###
**Phenotyping**

The TERRA-REF project is phenotyping the same genotypes of sorghum at multiple locations
 - Automated Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field System at Maricopa Agricultural Center (MAC)
 - PhenoTractors on parallel plots at MAC and Kansas State University (KSU)
 - UAV platform on parallel plots at KSU
 - Controlled-environment phenotyping systems at the Danforth Center

**Genotyping**

Whole genome resequencing is being carried out on ~400 sorghum accessions to understand the landscape of genetic variation in the selected germplasm and enable high-resolution mapping of bioenergy traits with genome wide association studies (GWAS). Additionally, ~200 sorghum recombinant inbred lines (RILs) will be characterized with ~400,000 genetic markers using genotyping-by-sequencing ([Morris et al., 2013](http://www.g3journal.org/content/early/2013/09/13/g3.113.008417)) for trait dissection in the RIL population and testcross hybrids of the RIL population.

The Scanalyzer 3D platform consists of multiple digital imaging chambers connected to the Conviron growth house by a conveyor belt system, resulting in a continuous imaging loop. Plants are imaged from the top and/or multiple sides, followed by digital construction of images for analysis.

- RGB imaging allows visualization and quantification of plant color and structural morphology, such as leaf area, stem diameter and plant height.

- NIR imaging enables visualization of water distribution in plants in the near infrared spectrum of 900–1700 nm.

- Fluorescent imaging uses red light excitation to visualize chlorophyll fluorescence between 680 – 900 nm. The system is equipped with a dark adaptation tunnel preceding the fluorescent imaging chamber, allowing the analysis of photosystem II efficiency.

The LemnaTec software suite is used to program and control the Scanalyzer platform, analyze the digital images and mine resulting data. Data and images are saved and stored on a secure server for further review or reanalysis.
