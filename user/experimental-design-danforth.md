#Controlled-Environment Phenotyping Experimental Designs

**Location**: The Automated controlled-environment phenotyping at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center Bellwether Foundation Phenotyping Facility

####Experiments LT1A (TM015) and LT1B (TM016)

**Duration**: 10 days on LemnaTec platform

**Experimental Design:**
* 3 replicates of [190 BAP lines](/user/sorghum_danforth_1.md) were grown in a randomized complete block design
* Watering regimes = 30% FC and 100% FC 
* Drought conditions were imposed 10 days after planting
* Plants were imaged daily for 10 days (11-20 DAP) and sampled at 20 days after planting
* Experiment was repeated twice to phenotype the full BAP (Reps 1A and 1B)
