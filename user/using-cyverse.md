# Using CyVerse

### About CyVerse

[CyVerse](http://www.cyverse.org/) is a National Science Foundation funded cyberinfrastructure that aims to democratize access to supercomputing capabilities. 

### Accessing Data via CyVerse

TERRA-REF data is accessible at CyVerse in two ways.

1. Publicly available data can be accessed anonymously through the [CyVerse Data Commons](http://datacommons.cyverse.org/browse/iplant/home/shared/terraref).
2. Publicly available data can also be accessed through the [CyVerse Discovery Environment](https://de.cyverse.org/de/) by navigating to the TERRA-REF Community Data folder at `/iplant/home/shared/terraref`.

Accessing data through the CyVerse Discovery Environment requires signing up for a free CyVerse account. The Discovery Environment gives users access to software and computing resources, so this method has the advantage that TERRA-REF data can be utilized directly without the need to copy the data elsewhere.
