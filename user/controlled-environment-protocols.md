### Procedure
**Chamber Conditions**

Pre-growth (11 days) and Phenotying (11 days)
 - 14 hour photoperiod
 - 32<sup>o</sup>C day/22<sup>o</sup>C night temperature
 - 60% relative humidity
 - 700 umol/m<sup>2</sup>/s light




**Watering Conditions**

 - Prior to phenotyping, plants watered daily
 - The first night after loading, plants watered 1× by treatment group to 100% field capacity (fc)
 - Days 2 – 12, plants watered 2× daily by treatment group (100% or 30% FC) to target weight

Target Weights
 - 100% field capacity = 480 g
 - 30% field capacity = 421 g




### Recipes

- **Field capacity** = 200% GWC (200 g water/100 g soil), based upon extensive GWC testing done by Skyler Mitchell
- **Target weight** (fc) = [(water weight at % fc) + [(average weight of carrier/saucer) + (dry soil weight) + (pot weight)]
- **Water weight** at 100% fc = dry soil weight * (%GWC/100)
- **Water weight** at 30% fc = water weight at 100% fc * 0.30
