#Experimental Design for Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona

###Manually Collected Field Data


7 experiments were conducted during the sorghum first-year planting.



|Experiment|Experimental Design|
| --- | --- |
| BAP | Biomass Association Panel, 3 reps, 30 lines (12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain), RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Night illumination | 3 reps, 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines (with check line separating illumination levels), RCB |
 | Row # | 3 reps, 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS) x 2 sides (east or west), RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
 | Biomass | 3 reps, 5 sampling times x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS), RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Density | 3 reps, 3 densities (5, 15, 30 cm) x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS), RCB |
 | RILs | 3 reps, 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep, Incomplete Block (row-column alpha lattice design) |
 | Uniformity | 17 reps, 2 lines (forage, PS), No experimental design - Same line planted in single range |
 | Range: | 54 ranges that run in the East-West direction, 4 m length per range (=3.5 m planted plus 0.5 m alley) |
 | Stand count: | Manual counts of all emerged plants with visible coleoptile, by row within plots. |

PI=photoperiod insensitive PS=photoperiod sensitive MPS= moderately photoperiod sensitive
