#Maricopa Agricultural Center Experimental Design  

## Season 1 (April - July 2016) 

[Three hundred thirty one lines were planted in 2016](/user/sorghum_MAC_1.md). Plantings occurred both [under ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=1066629008)and [west ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QQaWc0UaQQKfEtnSO1G2za8tKU2huC0_VYMBqm5CKAo/edit#gid=193038411)of the gantry system.

####Planting Design

| **Location** | **Experiment** | **Reps** | **Treatments** | **Experimental design** |
|----------------|--------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Gantry | BAP | 3 | 30 lines (12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain) | RCB with sorghum types nested in groups |
| Gantry | Night illumination | 3 | 5 illumination levels x 2 PS lines (with check line separating illumination levels) | RCB |
| Gantry | Row \# | 3 | 6 adjacent plot scenarios: 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS) x 2 sides (east or west) | RCB but not balanced with all treatments in all reps |
| Gantry | Biomass | 3 | 5 sampling times x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS) | RCB with sampling time as a repeated measure |
| Gantry | Density | 3 | 3 densities (5, 15, 30 cm) x 3 lines (forage, sweet, PS) | RCB |
| Gantry | RILs | 3 | 130 RILs plus 10 repeats of a single line/rep | Incomplete Block (row-column alpha lattice design) |
| Gantry | Uniformity | 17 | 2 lines (forage, PS) | None - Same line planted in single range |
| West of gantry | BAP | 1 | 30 lines (12 PS, 12 sweet, 6 grain) | None - single rep planted for observation |
| West of gantry | RILs | 3 | 60 RILs | Incomplete Block (row-column alpha lattice design) |

###Automated Phenotpying

The [Lemnatec Scanalyzer Field Gantry System](http://www.lemnatec.com/products/hardware-solutions/scanalyzer-field/) is the largest field crop analytics robot in the world. This high-throughput phenotyping field-scanning robot has a 30-ton steel gantry that autonomously moves along two 200-meter steel rails while continuously imaging the crops growing below it with a diverse array of [cameras and sensors](http://terraref.org/articles/lemnatec-scanalyzer-field-sensors/).


Twelve sensors are attached to the gantry system. Detailed information for each sensor including name, variable measured, and field of view are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=1886254108&single=true&widget=true&headers=false). The planned sensor missions and their objectives for 2016 are [available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Nfabx_n1rNlO6NW3olD8MAibJ3KHnOMmMwOYYw4wwGc/pubhtml?gid=2092320800&single=true&widget=true&headers=false).

###Manually Collected Field Data


7 experiments were conducted during the sorghum first-year planting.
