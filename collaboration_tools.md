# Web-based collaboration tools

For use by the TERRA Reference Phenotyping Standards Committee.


## Overview

All of the web-based software below provides the ability to organize projects hierarchically, facilitate sharing, and support collaboration.

### Essential tools

* **Github and Box**
     these are the primary tools the group will use for collaboration. 
* **Google Docs**
* 

### Additional tools

some of these are optional, many participants will not need to use them.

* **Etherpad** Meeting notes, and other collaborative note taking. Useful content can be transferred to GitHub, Box, or other platforms
* **Open Science Framework** provides a centralized portal to Github, Box, and other resources. All of these resources can be archived and assigned a doi. This will be useful for publishing specifications. 
* **ArcGIS online** will make it easy to visualize data.  


## Details:

### Box

* file sharing; UI has provided our group with 500GB of storage which should be plenty for example data and reference documents. 

### Open Science Framework (osf.io)

* for sharing files, provides a single portal to Github, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Figshare, Dataverse, Zotero, Mendeley
* makes it easy to archive (get a doi) for 'project snapshots' including subsets of data, documentation and etc. contained in above services



### ArcGIS Online http://arcg.is/1NwgxFe

* for visualizing and demonstrating reference data
* can share and annotate data
* make web-maps and applications

## Use, Reuse, and Access 

The Terraref team will generate public software, data, and educational materials. All materials will be provided with a permissive open-access license (MIT/BSD-compatible) and/or copyright (e.g. CC-By 4.0) by default. Content interested in restricting access to or reuse of material they provide should clearly label (e.g. with a LICENSE file or text in each file. All of the services allow access control; even though I've make everything public so far once you have an account you can make and control private subdirectories as you wish.
