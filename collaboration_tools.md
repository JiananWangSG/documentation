# Web-based collaboration tools

For use by the TERRA Reference Phenotyping Standards Committee.

## Overview

All of the web-based software below provides the ability to organize projects hierarchically, facilitate sharing, and support collaboration. Much of this is publicly viewable. 

For assistance - to request new integrations, directories, and groups, submit request to David LeBauer. We can set up, provide guideance, manage access, and (manage or transfer) administrative rights as needed.

These are handy off-the shelf tools with nice user-interfaces, but will not be integrated into the computational pipeline itself, which is focused on developing solutions for big data and high-performance computing and providing a suite of tools with permissive open source licenses (e.g. UI/NCSA, MIT, BSD, and compatible licenses).

### Core Communication Tools

* **Github** project management, website content and hosting, collaborative software development 
* **Box** references, specifications, example datasets, file sharing
* **Google Drive** collaborative editing of documents that we create (notes, manuscripts, etc)
* **OSF** central portal to Github, Box, Google Drive and data archiving

### Using Github:

* **Features**
  * Interface to 'git', a specialized command-line tool for version control. 
  * [code management / collaboration](https://github.com/features):  
  * Issue tracking and discussion forum https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
    * participants can reply to issues via email, similar to an email discussion list

* **[GitHub Documentation](https://guides.github.com/)** 
* **[GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)** 

## File Management

### Open Science Framework (osf.io)

* The **Open Science Framework** provides a centralized portal to Github, Box, Google Drive 
  * Can archive (get a doi) project snapshots that can be referenced (e.g. in publications) that combine material in the linked services
  * other features: edit text files, link to Figshare, Dataverse, Zotero, Mendeley, many others on the way

The main TERRA Ref project portal is https://osf.io/n532g/. This has links to the GitHub, Box, and Google Docs accounts used by the team.

### Box 

* https://uofi.box.com/terraref
* primary portal for sharing sample datasets, external reference documentation 
* project has 500GB of storage
* controlled access; 'shared' folder for public resources

### Google Docs

* for sharing and collaborating on documents (e.g. notes, drafts, etc)
* not for reference documentation, example datasets, that belong in Box 
* controlled access, 'shared' folder for public resources



## Use, Reuse, and Access 

The TERRA Ref team will generate public software, data, and educational materials. All materials will be provided with a permissive open-access license (MIT/BSD-compatible) and/or copyright (e.g. CC-By 4.0) by default. Content interested in restricting access to or reuse of material they provide should clearly label (e.g. with a LICENSE file or text in each file. 
All of the services allow access control; even though I've make everything public so far once you have an account you can make and control private subdirectories as you wish.
