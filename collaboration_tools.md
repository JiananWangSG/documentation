# Web-based collaboration tools

to be used by the TERRA Reference Phenotyping Standards Committee


## Overview

All of the web-based software below provides the ability to organize projects heirarchically and controll access  (e.g, subfolders in box, repositories on github). The name 'terraref' refers to the team leading the development of ARPA-E TERRA project's reference data and computing pipeline. 


Github and Box are the primary tools the group will use for collaboration. 


Open Science Framework provides a portal to Github, Box, and other resources that can be archived and assigned a doi, e.g. when we publish standard specifications. 

ArcGIS online will make it easy to visualize data. I've been using them successfully for a while. 

Etherpad is a place for drafting and shared note taking. The key advantage of etherpad is that you don't have to sign in to public documents. Any useful content can be transferred to github or Box.

I haven't finished preparing these resources for the group so it is not necessary to sign up yet, but if you want to get involved, let me know and I can give you access to these resources and any privileges you need.

## Details:

### Github:

* note that while 'git' is a specialized command-line tool for software development, GitHub provides much of what we need for collaboration in addition to what it provides for software development in particular.
* documentation: https://guides.github.com/
* our group repository: https://github.com/terraref/reference-data
  * a list of issues I've created for our group https://github.com/terraref/reference-data
* issue tracking / task management / discussion boards, https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
  * you can reply to issues via email, so this is similar to an email discussion list
* website hosting: https://pages.github.com/
* code management / collaboration:  https://github.com/features
* wiki https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/
* we can create private repositories

### Box 
* https://uofi.box.com/terraref
* file sharing; UI has provided our group with 250GB of storage which should be plenty for example data and reference documents. 

### Open Science Framework (osf.io)

* for sharing files, provides a single portal to Github, Box, Dropbox, Google Drive, Figshare, Dataverse, Zotero, Mendeley
* makes it easy to archive (get a doi) for 'project snapshots' including subsets of data, documentation and etc. contained in above services
 
### ArcGIS Online http://arcg.is/1NwgxFe

* for visualizing and demonstrating reference data
* can share and annotate data
* make web-maps and applications

### Other tools:

* Google Hangouts for conversations, can be recorded and shared (does anyone mind?)

### Summary:

Many of the choices are based on what the open science community is using, developing, and finding conducive to open science. For example to attract and build on the work of groups like rOpenSci, Software Carpentry, Data Carpentry, and the Center for Open Science. 

We will need to clarify what is open and what is proprietary. We can do this by marking confidential content as such and everything else mark as CC-BY (free to use with attribution) or CC-0 (anything goes). I'll start putting license files and CC labels on the resources mentioned above to make this clear - a public folder on Box, an open-source license in GitHub repositories, etc. All of the services allow access control; even though I've make everything public so far once you have an account you can make and control private subdirectories as you wish.
