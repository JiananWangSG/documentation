# Web-based collaboration tools

For use by the TERRA Reference Phenotyping Standards Committee.

## Overview

All of the web-based software below provides the ability to organize projects hierarchically, facilitate sharing, and support collaboration. Much of this is publicly viewable. 

For assistance - to request new integrations, directories, and groups, submit request to David LeBauer. We can set up, provide guideance, manage access, and (manage or transfer) administrative rights as needed.

These are handy off-the shelf tools with nice user-interfaces, but will not be integrated into the computational pipeline itself, which is focused on developing solutions for big data and high-performance computing and providing a suite of tools with permissive open source licenses (e.g. UI/NCSA, MIT, BSD, and compatible licenses).

### Core Communication Tools

* **Github** project management, website content and hosting, collaborative software development 
* **Box** references, specifications, example datasets, file sharing
* **Google Drive** collaborative editing of documents that we create (notes, manuscripts, etc)
* **OSF** central portal to Github, Box, Google Drive and data archiving 

### Additional tools

some of these are optional, many participants will not need to use them. Many tools may be useful, and where they provide unique functionality  

* **Etherpad** Handy for collaborative note taking (e.g. during meetings). This has minimal features, so any useful content can be transferred to Google Drive for further development or Github (e.g. for TODO items and documentation),   
* **ArcGIS online** User-friendly interface for GIS analysis and visualization, license is available via University of Illinois. Give it a whirl! 

## Details:

### Github:

* **Documentation** https://guides.github.com/
* **Features**
  * Interface to 'git', a specialized command-line tool for version control. 
  * code management / collaboration:  https://github.com/features
  * Issue tracking and discussion forum https://guides.github.com/features/issues/
    * participants can reply to issues via email, similar to an email discussion list
  * website hosting: 
    * documentation: https://pages.github.com/
  * wiki https://guides.github.com/features/wikis/
* we can create private repositories
  * Source Code
  * Additional Websites (e.g. for public audience)
* Can have private repositories (e.g. github.com/terraref/admin for project management)

Our Github sites:

* **Data products repository** https://github.com/terraref/reference-data
  * issues and milestones: https://github.com/terraref/reference-data/issues

### Box 

* https://uofi.box.com/terraref
* primary portal for sharing sample datasets, external reference documentation 
* project has 500GB of storage
* controlled access; 'shared' folder for public resources

### Google Docs

* for sharing and collaborating on documents (e.g. notes, drafts, etc)
* not for reference documentation, example datasets, that belong in Box 
* controlled access, 'shared' folder for public resources

### Open Science Framework (osf.io)

* main project https://osf.io/n532g/. access to data and computing sub-projects by request
  * **Open Science Framework** provides a centralized portal to Github, Box, Google Drive 
  * Can archive (get a doi) project snapshots that can be referenced (e.g. in publications) that combine material in the linked services
  * other features: edit text files, link to Figshare, Dataverse, Zotero, Mendeley, many others on the way


### ArcGIS Online http://arcg.is/1NwgxFe

* for visualizing and demonstrating reference data
* can share and annotate data
* make web-maps and applications

### Other tools:

* Google Hangouts for conversations, can be recorded and shared (with consent from all participants)

## Use, Reuse, and Access 

The Terraref team will generate public software, data, and educational materials. All materials will be provided with a permissive open-access license (MIT/BSD-compatible) and/or copyright (e.g. CC-By 4.0) by default. Content interested in restricting access to or reuse of material they provide should clearly label (e.g. with a LICENSE file or text in each file. All of the services allow access control; even though I've make everything public so far once you have an account you can make and control private subdirectories as you wish.
