#Data processing pipeline

### Maricopa Agricultural Center, Arizona

### Automated controlled-environment phenotyping, Missouri

At two points in the processing pipeline, metadata derived from collected data is inserted into BETYdb:

After transfer to NCSA, extractors running in Clowder will derive further metadata that will be pushed. This is a subset of the metadata that will also be stored in Clowder's database. The complete metadata definitions are still being determined, but will likely include:

- plant identifiers

- experiment and experimenter

- plant age, date, growth medium, and treatment

- camera metadata
