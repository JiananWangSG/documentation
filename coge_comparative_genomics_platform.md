# CoGe (Comparative Genomics)


[CoGe](https://genomevolution.org/coge/) supports the genomics pipeline required for the TERRA program for Sorghum sequence alignment and analysis. It has bot a web interface and REST API. CoGe is developed by Eric Lyons and hosted at the University of Arizona, where it is made available for researchers to use. CoGe can be hosted on any server, VM, or Docker container.

## Submitting Sequences to the CoGe Pipeline

1. Upload files to Cyverse data store. The TERRARef project has a 2TB allocation 
2. Use icommands to transfer to data store
