### [TERRA Reference Data (/bety)](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety) 

This will contain data generated by the field scanner in Maricopa, the indoor phenotyping system at Danforth, field trials at Kansas State, and other contributed data.

It will contain both sensor based and manually collected data, and will label each data point according to the method used to collect it.

This server is set up for testing. Currently it contains over 15 million simulated trait and yield records.

## Getting Started

There a few ways to get started using BETYdb. These are all covered in the BETYdb data access documentation.

* **Data Access** 
  * Go to your project's instance of BETYdb.org, search by species and trait, and download csv. 
  * Use the rOpenSci traits package to search for data in R. 
  * Use either the original or beta API
 
* **Developer Sandbox** 
  * If you are interested in deploying a 'sandbox' version:
    * installing the Postgres database ([Documentation](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/pecan-documentation/content/Installing-PEcAn#install-database--data))
    * Installing the Ruby-on-Rails app ([Documentation](https://pecan.gitbooks.io/betydb-documentation/content/Installing-the-BETYdb-Rails-Application))
    * Install a [PEcAn Virtual Machine](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/projects/artifacts.php?key=PECAN)
