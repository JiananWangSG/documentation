#Data Transfer


### Automated controlled-environment phenotyping, Missouri

**Transferring images**

Processes at Danforth monitor the database repository where images captured from the Scanalyzer are stored. After initial processing, files are transferred to NCSA servers for additional metadata extraction, indexing and storage.

The current "beta" Python script can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/terraref/computing-pipeline/blob/master/scripts/PlantcvClowderUploader.py). During transfer tests of data from Danforth's sorghum pilot experiment, 2,725 snapshots containing 10 images each were uploaded in 775 minutes (3.5 snapshots/minute).

**Transfer volumes**

The Danforth Center transfers approximately X GB of data to NCSA per week.
