# Data Processing Pipeline


## Pipeline overview



1.	Calibration, Pre-processing
1.	Transfer data from sensor to storage
1.	Automated initial QA/QC 
1.	messages to operators
1.	Apply metadata (geospatial, environmental, biological, time, calibration settings)
1.	Geospatial (ortho-rectification) and image stitching
1.	Import to array database
1.	Phenotype extraction pipeline
1.	Import phenotypes and metadata to database
1.	Store files
1.	Post summaries to web:
1.	 Generate and update daily, monthly and seasonal summaries of data
  *	Post logs, QA/QC, data summaries, and visualizations to the web
  *	Plots for QA/QC
  *	Publicize availability 
1.	Daily visual inspection by engineers and system operators
1.	Weekly summaries inspected by scientists
1.	Post-season quality control and re-analysis with standard algorithms
