#Using BETYdb

[**BETYdb**](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/) contains plot locations and other geolocations of interest (e.g. fields, rows, plants) that are associated with agronomic experimental design / meta-data (what was planted where, field boundaries, treatments, etc).

### Using the Advanced Search box

Most tables in BETYdb have search boxes, for example betydb.org/citations and betydb.org/sites. We describe below how to queried and downloaded these pages as .csv, .json, or .xml. The advanced search box is the easiest way to download summary datasets designed to have enough information (location, time, species, citations) to be useful for a wide range of use cases.

### Using the Search Box

On the welcome page of BETYdb there is a search option for trait and yield data (Figure \ref{fig:textsearch}). This tool allows users to search the entire collection of trait and yield data for specific sites, citations, species, and traits.+

The results page provides a map interface and the option to download a file containing search results.
The downloaded file is in CSV format. This file provides meta-data and provenance information, including: the SQL query used to extract the data, the date and time the query was made, the citation source of each result row, and a citation for BETYdb itself.

_Instructions_: Using the search box to search trait and yield data is very simple: Type the site (city or site name), species (scientific or common name), citation (author and/or year), or trait (variable name or description) into the search box and the results will show contents of BETYdb that match the search. The number of records per page can be changed to viewer preference and the search results can be downloaded in the Excel-compatible CSV format.

The search map may be used in conjunction with search terms to restrict search results to a particular geographical area or even a specific site by clicking on a map. Clicking on a particular site will restrict results to that site. Clicking in the vicinity of a group of sites but not on a particular site will restrict the search to the region around the point clicked. Alternatively, if a search using search terms is done without clicking on the map, all sites associated with the returned results are highlighted on the map. Sites, species and traits can be searched further by clicking on or near highlighted locations on the map. The color of each site indicates which sites match the search terms. Results can be downloaded by clicking the "Download Results" button on the upper right hand corner of the page.
