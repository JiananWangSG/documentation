#Running a Sample Extractor

## Setting up a test environment for development

 [The NCSA Clowder wiki](https://opensource.ncsa.illinois.edu/confluence/display/CATS/Administrating+Clowder) provides an up-to-date installation guide for Clowder.

In a fresh installation, Clowder is not configured with an email server - it does not send confirmation when someone registers for an account the confirmation email will not be sent correctly. However the Clowder console will still display the contents of the email, so the confirmation URL can be copied from there.
