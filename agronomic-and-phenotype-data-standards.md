# Agronomic and Phenotype Data Standards

### Current Practice

In TERRA-REF v0 release, agronomic and phenotype data is stored and exchanged using the [BETYdb API](https://terraref.ncsa.illinois.edu/bety/api/docs). Agronomic data is stored in the `sites`, `managements`, and `treatments` tables. Phenotype data is stored in the `traits`, `variables`, and `methods` tables.  Data is ingested and accessed via the BETYdb API formats.

### Standardization Efforts

In cooperation with participants from [AgMIP](http://research.agmip.org/display/research/Welcome+to+AgMIP+Research), the [Crop Ontology](http://www.cropontology.org/), and [Agronomy Ontology ](https://github.com/AgriculturalSemantics/agro)groups, the TERRA-REF team is pursuing the development of a format to facilitate the exchange of data across systems based on the ICASA Vocabulary and AgMIP JSON Data Objects. An initial draft of this format is available for public comment on [Github.](https://github.com/craig-willis/icasa)

The goal of this project is to enable the exchange of data between TERRA-REF and the [Plant Breeding API](/docs.brapi.apiary.io), Breeding Management System, and related servies.
